# Independent verification integration

## Imported mount tranche — 7 September 2026

Source: `mmsanders/digital-tape-verification`, immutable commit
`4ee116fa040bb5ce040325e0076365abf8b0f8f9`, directory `tests/mount_draft8/`.
All tracked files imported verbatim. The nested `spec/` is an authenticated test
baseline, not another canonical publication point; product authority is `spec/`.
All four files compare byte-for-byte with the DRAFT-8 issued through PR #25.

Reproduction: `make -C tests/mount_draft8 check`. Reproduced locally: ten package
self-tests pass, including fixture authentication, 289 fixture verdicts, deliberately
bad observations, negative engine control, missing-engine failure and callback
instrumentation. These are NOT 289 passing engine tests or work-package acceptance.

The imported README, ADAPTER.md and COVERAGE.md are the independent authority for
the test boundary. The verifier's return and clean paper review are reproduced
under `docs/verification/` with their original authorship intact.

Structural Rule 1: this test-only change lands before any newly covered engine
implementation. The main engine still contains the older provisional read path.
Actual engine linking/execution is the next integration step, not part of this
test-only delivery. No assertions, expected results, fixture bytes or cases changed.

VT8-001 remains held: allocation events and running cartridge-sequence consumption
are not observable through this mount probe. No allocator, commit, operation,
rendered PCM, complete state-row or full WP-07 acceptance follows from this import.
PR #20 cannot merge wholesale. Full green WP-10, independent WP-11 goldens, WP-12a
and hardware acceptance remain separate requirements.
